<h1>#@ Gridr Concept</h1></br> 
Working version of the Gridr concept in its latest version.</br> 
Vision:<br/>
Help to discover, build and leverage local networks. Provide a platform to support local collaboration betweeen people through tools and concepts.
<br/><br/>
Ground rules:<br/>
->People over tools!<br/>
The local connections and trust networks betweeen people are always more important than any tools meant to help them. Practical solutions overrule tools and all concepts are ment to be adopted for the own local needs.<br/>
->Be Nice!<br/>
Gridr is about a community of collaborators. Honesty is appreciated and necessary, but always stay nice and fair with your peers!<br/>
<br/>
->Assume the best intend in people!<br/>
Always assume the best intend in people and as basis for their actions.<br/>
If it seems to be bad or wrong, find out why they are doing what they are doing before starting to blame anyone.<br/>
<br/>
->Stakeholder value rules!<br/>
Actions should make sense for all stakeholders, this includes users, developers, organizers and supporters. <br/>
